ATM Backend Console Application (Java, OOPS)

A simple console-based ATM backend simulation written in Java, demonstrating core OOP concepts such as interfaces, inheritance, method overriding, and encapsulation. The app simulates typical ATM flows: card insertion, language selection, PIN verification, withdraw, deposit, balance check, and PIN reset with OTP.

Features

Console-driven user interaction (Scanner + System.out.println()).

PIN verification flow for transaction security.

Withdraw with amount validation (multiples of 100) and balance update.

Deposit with account type selection.

Balance inquiry (protected by PIN).

Reset PIN flow using an OTP simulation and validation.

Simple UPI placeholder method for future extension.

Simulated processing delays (Thread.sleep()) for realistic feel.

Class responsibilities (explanation)

atm_interface
Declares core ATM operations: withdraw(), deposit(), resetPin(), checkBalance(), upay().

BankAccount
Stores account-related data (balance/amount, account number, pin, Scanner sc, Random random) and provides get/set methods. Serves as the shared data layer.

NewUserCheckIn
Base class extending BankAccount and implementing atm_interface. Intended as a parent for concrete operation classes. You can make it abstract to force subclasses to implement methods.

Pin_Verification
Encapsulates logic to prompt the user for a PIN, compare to stored PIN, and return boolean success/failure. Used by operations that require PIN access.

User_Menu
Responsible for displaying the menu to the user (Withdraw, Check Balance, Deposit, Reset PIN, UPI, Exit), reading their choice, and delegating to an atm_interface implementation.

Withdraw
Implements withdraw() (ensure method name matches interface). Prompts for amount (multiples of 100), validates balance, deducts amount from BankAccount, simulates processing delay, and optionally shows remaining balance.

Deposit
Implements deposit(); prompts for account type, amount, and updates BankAccount balance.

ResetPin
Implements resetPin() and provides OTP generation & verification, new PIN validation (4-digit), and PIN confirmation.

CheckBalance
Implements checkBalance() and uses Pin_Verification to show balance only after successful PIN check.

How it works (flow)

Start — Atm_MainClass.main() prints card insertion messages, simulates delay, then displays language options.

Language — User selects a language (currently just calls the same User_Menu.menu() for all choices).

Menu — User_Menu.menu() displays options and reads the user selection.

Dispatch — Based on selection, it creates or uses an object implementing atm_interface and calls the corresponding method:

withdraw() → Withdraw.withdraw() (validates PIN first)

deposit() → Deposit.deposit() (validates PIN first if implemented)

checkBalance() → CheckBalance.checkBalance() (PIN required)

resetPin() → ResetPin.resetPin() (OTP + new PIN)

upay() → placeholder for future UPI flow

Transaction — Methods update BankAccount state (balance / pin) and return control to menu or exit.

Setup & Run

Create the project folder and a subfolder atm. Put all .java files inside atm/.

Compile and run from the parent directory.

# From project root (the directory that contains the 'atm' folder)
# Compile all .java files
javac atm/*.java

# Run the main class (note the package name)
java atm.Atm_MainClass


If you use an IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse), open a new Java project, add atm package and files, then run Atm_MainClass.
